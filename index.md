Hello! I'm Emil Sayahi, a script kid from Cincinnati, a city on the east coast of America. This is my website, which I'll use to catalogue all the various things I may or may not do over time. Hopefully, four years down the line I'll have a portfolio of work that'll be presentable, filled with things that'll show the kind of work ethic and knowledge I have. 

### Education

I currently attend Turpin High School, a suburban public school that has been able to provide many great opportunities, including:
- A programming course covering general logic
- An engineering course that involved teaching AutoCAD
- A STEM course that required us to learn basic 3D modeling in Sketchup
- An opportunity to go to Live Oaks, a vocational school with a strong STEM focus, especially on programming.
- An INTERalliance chapter which provided many educational opportunities, such as one-day crash course classes and a technology expo focused on creating a product built to help the local community

Besides my school education, I've taught myself VB.NET (the .NET Framework version of Visual Basic), some C#, the logic behind programming of all kinds, and general things, like what file types are for what, what programs to use to achieve various goals and the whatnot. Take this website for example. Just to get this website up, I had to learn the answers to the following questions:
1. What is the Git protocol that everyone is talking about, why does GitHub exist, and how will they help me?
2. How do I put a site up online? How do I get a domain name and webpages to back it up with?
3. What is the underlying language that makes up a webpage? What is it called and what are its rules?
4. How do I create a base site using said language that will be easily modifiable in the future?
5. What is this DNS managment thing people keep mentioning in all of these articles, and how could this Cloudflare thing that everyone uses help me with that?
6. How do I get my own independent e-mail address, with my own branding and all?

I had to have prior knowledge relating to all of these questions to figure out how to get these words to you to begin with. I learned the answers to these questions from years of lurking online, reading articles, and actually implementing my knowledge to create websites for myself and my brother (which are likely long gone by the time you're reading this).

### My work
This is where things go downhill. Press 'F' to pay respects to any momentum I had going into this paragraph. I'm fourteen years old as I'm writing this, so sorry I don't have much to show you. I haven't done much worth presenting other than this website that you're looking at. I've made some things here and there over the years, sure, but I don't think the various little coding doodads that I'd made to teach myself (which usually ended up lost on the dead laptops I killed when I was far younger, RIP) are going to get me into the tech industry. I'm currently focusing on making my highschool career a four year period of professional development and learning, so I can become more than just some script kid that begins interesting projects that gives up before letting anything fizzle into being. I'm going to make some stuff worth presenting, and you're gonna look at them, and if you don't then I'll force you and yes, that is a threat. Seeya around 'till then, Space Cowboy. If you want to keep in touch with me, shoot me an e-mail at: [`em@emsa.cf`](mailto:em@emsa.cf). Thanks.
