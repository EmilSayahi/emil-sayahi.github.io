Heyo, I'm Emil, a Swedish-Finnish-American script kid in Cincinnati who likes tinkerin' around! I program and do work in CAD modeling. This is my website, which I'll use to catalogue all the various things I've done over time. Hopefully, by four years after I've set up this site I'll have a portfolio of work that'll be presentable; filled with things that'll show the kind of work ethic and knowledge I have. 

### Education & Experience

I currently attend Turpin High School, a suburban public school that has been able to provide many great opportunities, including:
- A programming course covering Python and constructs present in most languages (Comments, booleans, 'if' statements, comparison operators, logical operations, short circuit evaluation, De Morgan's laws, floating point numbers, 'while' loops, 'for' loops, 'break' and 'continue', nested control structures, functions [+ parameters & return values], exception handling, indexing & slicing, string immutability, slicing & concatenation, the 'in' keyword, various string methods, tuples, lists, and list methods.)
- An engineering course that involved learning CAD modeling.
- A STEM course that required us to learn basic 3D modeling in Sketchup.
- An opportunity to go to Live Oaks, a vocational school with a strong STEM focus, especially on programming and engineering.
- An [INTERalliance](http://interalliance.org/) chapter which provided many educational opportunities, such as one-day crash course classes and participation in a local tech-expo.

Besides my school education, I've taught myself VB.NET (the Microsoft .NET Framework version of Visual Basic), some C#, the logic behind programming of all kinds, and other non-specific things, like 3D mapping in the Source Engine (although I haven't worked in Source in years). A good example to show to demonstrate my computer competence would be the very existence of this website. Just to get this website up, I had to solve the following problems:
1. How can I manage my code under a version control system for easy revisioning.
2. How can I obtain a domain name along with hosting to put the website out there?
3. How should the site be designed from a visual standpoint. What are the intended aesthetics?
4. How can I use freely available online resources to become proficient enough in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete the website?
5. How do I keep the communications between incoming connections and the website managed and secure?

Without competence, knowledge, and a good work ethic, you wouldn't be reading this now would you?

### Work
Sorry I don't have much to show you for right now. I hadn't been working on cataloguing my work until I turned fourteen, so a lot of my old experiments and creations are lost to the sands of time. They were garbage anyway, so I'll be focusing on making my highschool career a four year period of professional development and learning, so I can have something to present to you. I'll leave you alone now. Go and take a look at what I have here. Seeya around, Space Cowboy. If you want to contact me, shoot me an e-mail at: [`em@emsa.cf`](mailto:em@emsa.cf?subject=I'm gonna make you a billionaire! ...). Thanks.

## [Chrome Search Extension Base](https://github.com/emil-sayahi/Chrome-Search-Base)
This was a simple Chrome extension meant for easy modification that implemented searching via a keyword preceding the user's search term typed into the Chrome omnibox.


## [3D Modeling](https://github.com/emil-sayahi/Sketchup-House/)
I had to model an entire house and the things inside of it a couple years ago for a generic STEM class in middle school. Take a look.


## [Hello Plugin](https://github.com/emil-sayahi/Hello-Plugin)
This was a simple SourceMod plugin for Source Engine game servers. It printed "Hello!" in the chat when activated by the command /hello. For testing purposes.


## [Calculator](https://github.com/emil-sayahi/Calculator)
Just a calculator? Yep. This was a calculator made in VB.NET many, many years ago. I found it and put it up on GitHub to prove that I can use Visual Studio and that I know VB.NET to a certain extent. Not much else to say on it.

## [TryMath](http://emsa.cf/trymath.html)
I tried getting math text to render on the site. When it did, I decided to make a Python script to calculate the stupid equation I bothered to render.


## [OpenTK Rendering Experiment](https://github.com/emil-sayahi/TriBox)
This was a rendering program that was intended to be a game engine using OpenGL, written in C#, based on a collection of model loader classes called Meshomatic. It could load basic .OBJ models. Mainly what I managed to accomplish with this was loading in different kinds of models and manipulating their positions on screen by transforming the camera.


## [Isla Delphiino](https://github.com/emil-sayahi/Isla-Delphiino)
This was a work-in-progress utility for packaging up a portable copy of the Dolphin emulator and a Wii or Gamecube .ISO into a single, portable executable. The main result of this was not a utility, as I eventually learned it was impossible not only because of the legal consequences that I was aware of prior to development, but also because the UI code of Dolphin, which uses Wx, cannot be removed (as it is old and horribly designed). <br>
What I got out of this project was a UI that was an extremely accurate replication of the Wii system settings UI, which showed how good I was in reverse engineering user interfaces by performing visual and functionsl analysis on the UI.


## [Lime School](https://limeschool.cf)
This is a school blog that contains the work of the classes I've taken that have asked me to host a blog. Code is on GitHub, and it runs on Jekyll. Taught me how to use a CMS, markdown, Jekyll, GitHub Pages, and Cloudflare.


## CAD 3D Modeling (Part Drafting)
I've drafted a lot of complex parts for my Engineering & Drafting class. Take a look around.

## [SketchSpace](https://github.com/EmilSayahi/SketchSpace)
SketchSpace is a Jekyll-ran system of publishing web comics to the web. It's made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in an effort to make it as static as possible within the realm of reason.


##[Basic-Jekyll](https://github.com/EmilSayahi/basic-jekyll/)
Basic-Jekyll is a port of ['Basic'](https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/basic), a theme for [Pelican](http://getpelican.com/) to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
